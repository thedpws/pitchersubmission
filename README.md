# Revised README for Pitchr midterm submission

This is a revised version of the README for our midterm submission.

## Project Description
Pitchr (formerly Pitcher) is a framework for composing music. Pitchr lets you quickly prototype snippets of music, allowing composers and music students alike to write, listen to, and view music. It features a common interface between Note objects, Measure objects, and Staff objects which creates a unified and intuitive way to interact with music.

## Package name for PIP Installation
For pip installation do `pip3 install pitchr`

## Executable command
The example project is included in `demo.zip` and includes instructions to run it.

## Link to repository
We use a public GitHub repository: (https://github.com/thedpws/pitcher.git). The zipped `pitcher.zip` is the project version released by the time of the midterm deadline.
